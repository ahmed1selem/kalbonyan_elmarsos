the spread operator
is actually a bit similar to destructuring,
because it also helps us get elements out of arrays.
Now, the big difference is that the spread operator
takes all the elements from the array
and it also doesn't create new variables.
And as a consequence, we can only use it
in places where we would otherwise
write values separated by commas.
the spread operator
works in all irtables among them are array

multiple values separated by a comma
are usually only expected
when we pass arguments into a function,
or when we build a new array.
short circuiting evalouation
if the first value is a truthy vaule so it
will reaturn it without locking to more data
if the or didn't find a truthy val it will return the last
val checked no matter of it's condition
in and it's the contrary it reaturn the last one
you can right that
restaurant.orderPasta&&restaurant.orderPizza('mushrooms','spinach')
insted of if in both || and &&
The Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
is the same as || but insted of falsy valeus we have
Nullish val=null and undifined
And so basically, what the logical
and assignment operator does
is to assign a value to a variable
if it is currently truthy.
